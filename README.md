# GyroPalm Kinetic
GyroPalm Kinetic is a Wireless Force Transfer Mechanism device that enables users to discreetly manipulate objects at high velocities. This mechanism can be used in Escape Rooms, magic shows, and games to provide an interactive Sci-Fi experience.

## Inspiration
Various Sci-Fi movies such as Star Wars, Iron Man, Stranger Things, Kung Fu Hustle, etc demonstrate one or more characters having extraordinary capabilities to manipulate physical objects with the power of their mind. Typically, such telekinetic actions are conveyed to the audience by the actor performing a unique "gesture" such as "thrusting" their palm in the air in the linear motion that they want an object to go. Thanks to GyroPalm's patented technology, many of these effects can be achieved in real life.

In **Star Wars**, many refer to these abilities as the *Force* (i.e. "May the Force be with you"). 

In **Iron Man**, the capabilities to move objects is achieved through jet repulsors which are mounted in the palms of the armor's hands. 

In the **Stranger Things** series, Eleven (the main protagonist) demonstrates these capabilities through by her "training" at Hawkins Labs at a young age.

In **Kung Fu Hustle**, the main protagonist demonstrates his powers by using the myth of the "Iron Palm" technique to knock down a building.

## Technical Overview
To enable people to enjoy similar experiences for entertainment, GyroPalm Kinetic comprises a spring-loaded retraction mechanism that is released by a pivot latch via a small servo motor. The metal spring is connected to a near-invisible thread that is ultimately attached to the physical object to be moved. To provide wireless triggering, the servo motor is connected to an ESP32 microcontroller such as the M5StickC Plus. This enables wireless capabilities with GyroPalm wearable protocols such as ESP NOW.

To enable discrete operation, the entire unit is miniaturized such that it can be mounted underneath a table. The near-invisible thread is tied to a modular piece that is detached (by gravity) immediately after the object is accelerated.
